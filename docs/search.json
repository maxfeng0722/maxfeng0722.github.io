The x-axis is the year ranging from 1896 to 2016, and the y-axis is the height of the athletes in centimeters. The red data points represent female athletes while the green data points represent male athletes."

The x-axis is the value of different lengths, and the y-axis is the number of shows at a certain value of the title length. In general, the distribution is right-skewed. Most shows have the title length between 8-16 characters. Very few shows have the title length greater than 50 characters.\nPart III: Rating Systems of the Shows\n\nggplot(netflix_titles, aes(x = rating, fill = rating)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  geom_label(stat = \"count\", aes(label = after_stat(count))) +\n  labs(title = \"distribution of the rating systems of shows\", \n       x = \"rating systems\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this analysis, I made a bar graph that analyzes the number of Netflix shows with different rating systems. The x-axis is the different rating systems and the y-axis is the number of shows that use a specific rating system. TV-MA has the most uses in shows, with 2863 shows that fall into this category. Very few shows use NC-17, TV-Y7-FV, and UR."
