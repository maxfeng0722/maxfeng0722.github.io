    "text": "In this project, I simulated the room draw process where students are randomly assigned an order to pick the rooms. I wanted to know the probability of a student Max getting a preferred room, given different number of students and number of rooms. To make the case simpler, I assumed that all the rooms are singles (so there are always more or an equal number of rooms than students). Also, Max has preferences for three rooms that are randomly generated. Everyone picks a random room and when it comes to Max’s turn, if any of the rooms that he prefers is still not occupied, then he gets to choose that room and therefore he gets the preferred room. Otherwise, he does not get the preferred room.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nroom_draw &lt;- function(room, student, preference){\n  room_number &lt;- 1:room\n  my_order &lt;- sample(1:student, 1)\n  my_preferred_room &lt;- sample(room_number, preference, replace = FALSE)\n  earlier_picks &lt;- c()\n  if (my_order != 1) {\n    earlier_picks &lt;- sample(room_number, my_order - 1)\n  }\n  for (i in my_preferred_room){\n    if (!(i %in% earlier_picks)) {\n      return (TRUE)\n    }\n  }\n  return (FALSE)\n}\n\nsimulation &lt;- function(room, student, preference = 3, n = 1000){\n  return(sum(replicate(n, room_draw(room, student, preference))))\n}\n\ndf &lt;- expand_grid(student = seq(400, 1600, by = 50),\n                  ratio = seq(1.0, 2.0, by = 0.1),\n                  preference = c(3)) |&gt;\n  mutate(room = student * ratio)\n\nset.seed(47)\nsim_results &lt;- df |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    success = pmap(list(room, student, preference), \n                  ~ simulation(room = ..1, student = ..2, preference = ..3)),\n    prob = as.numeric(success) / 1000\n    )\n\nIn the code block above, I started with a function that simulates the room draw process. The output is TRUE if Max gets his preferred room and FALSE if he doesn’t. Then, I wrote a second function that does the simulation 1000 times given the study number and room number. I created a data frame that has four columns. The first column is the student counts from 400 to 1600 in steps of 50. Each student count has eleven rows. The second column is a ratio between room count and student count from 1.0 to 2.0 in steps of 0.1. The fourth column is the actual room count given the ratio and student count of each row. The third column is the number of preferred rooms, which is set to be 3. I ran the simulation 1000 times to each row of data and concluded with the probability of getting the preferred room in each scenario.\n\nggplot(sim_results, aes(x = student, y = prob)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_text_repel(aes(label = room), size = 1.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Room Draw Success Probability 1\",\n    x = \"Number of Students\",\n    y = \"Probability of Getting a Preferred Room\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(sim_results, aes(x = room, y = prob)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_text_repel(aes(label = student), size = 1.0) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Room Draw Success Probability 2\",\n    x = \"Number of Rooms\",\n    y = \"Probability of Getting a Preferred Room\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, I made two scatterplots to visualize the results from the previous section. In the first plot, the x-axis is the number of students and the label of each point is the number of rooms. The y-axis is the probability of getting a preferred room in each scenario. In the second plot, the y-axis is the same variable, while the x-axis is the number of rooms and the label of each point is the number of students. According to the plots, when the number of students and the number of rooms are the same, the probability of getting a preferred room is around 0.75. When the number of rooms are twice the number of students, the probability of getting a preferred room increases to around 0.95. With a fixed room count, the more students there are, the less likely Max is getting a preferred room. With a fixed student count, the more rooms there are, the more likely Max is getting a preferred room.\nIn conclusion, in this simulation, I explored the probability of a student getting a preferred room with varying room count and student count. The effect of number of preferences on the probability can also be investigated using the functions I created. Also, the room count and the student count can also be easily manipulated to explore a specific scenario one wants."

    "text": "Privacy is widely recognized as a stringent right of human beings. In data science, data anonymization helps ensure individuals’ privacy by removing personal information of the respondants. However, as computational techniques become more advanced, supposedly anonymized data can be re-identified, which leads to some serious ethical concerns.\nIn this project, I will analyze this ethical concern by scrutinizing two news articles that highlight the problem of poorly anonymized data and responding to four important questions. The first article by Dan Goodin introduces a data set of New York City taxi trip records that revealed the detailed comings and goins of individual taxi drivers over more than 173 million trips. In order to preserve taxi drivers’ privacy, their hack license numbers and medallion numbers were obscured using the MD5 algorithm. This algorithm converts a medallion number or hack number to a longer string with letters and numbers. For example, medallion number 9Y99 or hack number 5296319 were converted to 71b9c3f3ee5efb81ca05e9b90c91c88f and 98c2b1aeb8d40ff826c6f1580a600853. Because they’re one-way hashes, they can’t be mathematically converted back into their original values. However, this model has proven to be flawed since a software developer successfully de-anonymized all the data. In the second article by Natasha Singer, the author incorporates many cases with poorly anonymized data and thereby claims that the old model of anonymization is no longer effective in the metadata era. One case that is brought to most attention is an analysis of credit card transactions by 1.1 million people in 10000 stores over a three-month period. Personal details were removed from the data set, but the columns contained in the data set are enough to re-identify 90 percent of the shoppers.\nThe first question to respond to is: Were the data made publicly available? In the first article regarding NYC taxi trip records, the data were made publicly available. Indeed, the data were released in response to a public records request. However, though more information regarding drivers’ movements was revealed to public, taxi drivers’ personal information was also leaked by decoding the encryption and therefore, their privacy rights were infringed. In the second article, the data of credit card transactions were also made publicly available, which is exactly the reason why the ethical concern of revealing personal identity was raised.\nThe second item to respond to is: Is the data identifiable? All of it? Some of it? In what way? Are the data sufficiently anonymized or old to be free of ethical concerns? Is anonymity guaranteed? In the first article regarding NYC taxi trip records, all of the data became identifiable after running all possible iterations of the patterns structured by the MD5 algorithm. According to the article, the data were not sufficiently anonymized since NYC officials could do the following two things to improve the anonymity: assigning a random number to each hack license number and medallion number and creating a secret AES key to encrypt each value individually. In the second article, 90% of the data became identifiable after combining the disclosed items in the data set (the date of each transaction, amount charged and name of the store) with publicly available information (Instagram or Twitter posts). In this case, the researchers tried their best to make their data anonymized. However, with a huge amount of addition data, it is still possible to deduce personal information.\nThe third item to consider is the eleventh of Data Values and Principles Manifesto, which states that “as data teams, we aim to protect the privacy and security of individuals represented in our data”. This item is closely related to the ethical concern of privacy infringement. In both cases, the data teams did not successfully protect the privacy of the individuals. In the first article, taxi drivers’ personal information as well as their movements were revealed by cracking the encryption. In the second article, credit card users’ personal identity and each of their transactions were revealed by the released data and additional public data on the Internet.\nThe fourth item to ruminate is the first item of Data Values and Principles Manifesto, contending that “as data teams, we aim to use data to improve life for our users, customers, organizations, and communities”. I think that both data sets help improve life for the communities. In the first case of NYC taxi trip records, the NYC officials could have a better sense of the areas that had the most taxis driving by, which implies that those areas may need more taxis around so that people can find an available taxi faster and life gets more convenient. In the second case of credit card transactions, the data set is worth studying as it outlines the living patterns and habits of individuals. Scientists will be able to infer the individuals’ decision-making processes and conclude brilliant findings in psychology and sociology.\nThe two chosen articles provide different perspectives to analyze the ethical concern of privacy. The first article presents a case where the anonymization process is flawed and can be improved. The second article provides bad news to the entire anonymization process: any de-identification methods can be cracked and there is always the threat to disclose personal information. Does this mean we should stop producing public data? I don’t this is the case either as the two articles have proven that the datasets can make life easier and better. Therefore, in face of the awkward situation, another ethical dilemma between data disclosure and privacy is put forward: if data are destined to infringe privacy, how many datasets and how much information should we disclose publicly to make a balance between data and privacy?\nReferences\nGoodin, D. (2014). Poorly anonymized logs reveal NYC cab drivers’ detailed whereabouts. Ars Technica.\nSinger, N. (2015). With a few bits of data, researchers identify “anonymous” people. The New York Times."

    "text": "In this analysis, I used SQL to query a database that includes both city PD as well as highway patrol traffic incidents from 42 different states (Pierson et al., 2020). I picked three data sets that recorded data from three areas: Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago. In the three data sets, I delved into the the total number of traffic stops (pedestrian or vehicular) and examined its relationship with other variables such as race, day, and hour. For each analysis, I made a plot to visualize the data and we could make some conclusions based on the plot.\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\ncon_traffic &lt;- DBI::dbConnect(\n  RMariaDB::MariaDB(),\n  dbname = \"traffic\",\n  host = Sys.getenv(\"TRAFFIC_HOST\"),\n  user = Sys.getenv(\"TRAFFIC_USER\"),\n  password = Sys.getenv(\"TRAFFIC_PWD\")\n)\nSELECT type, COUNT(*) AS num_stops, subject_race\nFROM ca_los_angeles_2020_04_01\nGROUP BY subject_race, type\nORDER BY type, num_stops;\nrace_table |&gt;\n  drop_na(type) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = subject_race, y = num_stops, fill = type)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(x = \"race\", y = \"number of stops\", title = \"number of pedestrian and vehicular stops of each race\")\nThe code above represents my first analysis. I picked the data set from Los Angeles. I made a bar plot where the x-axis is the race of the subjects and the y-axis is the total number of stops. The blue region represents the number of vehicular stops and the red region represent the number of pedestrian stops. From the plot, there are more vehicular stops than pedestrian stops among all races. Hispanic people have the greatest number of stops, followed by black, white, other and asian/pacific islander.\nSELECT count(*) AS num_stops, DAYNAME(date) AS wday\nFROM ca_san_francisco_2020_04_01\nWHERE subject_race = \"white\"\nGROUP BY wday\nORDER BY num_stops DESC;\nwhite_wday_table |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = wday, y = num_stops)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(x = \"day\", y = \"number of stops\", title = \"number of stops of white people on each day\")\nIn the second analysis, I looked at the data set from San Francisco. I only focused on the data from white subjects. I made a bar plot where the x-axis is the day of a week and the y-axis is the total number of stops. The plot shows that in San Francisco, there are a larger number of traffic incidents on one of the weekdays than on one of the weekends. Wednesday have the greatest number of stops, followed by Thursdays, Tuesdays, Fridays, Mondays, Saturdays, and Sundays.\nSELECT count(*) AS num_stops, EXTRACT(HOUR FROM time) AS hour\nFROM il_chicago_2023_01_26\nGROUP BY hour\nORDER BY num_stops DESC;\nhour_table |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = num_stops)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(y = \"number of stops\", title = \"number of stops in every hour\")\nIn the third analysis, I examined the data set from Chicago. I wanted to know the number of stops in each hour. Therefore, I made a scatterplot where the x-axis is each hour of a day and the y-axis is the number of total stops. Results showed that most of the traffic incidents occurred during the night, from 5pm to 12am. 8pm has the most number of total stops, followed by 7pm, 6pm, 5pm, 9pm, 10pm, 11pm, 12am, 4pm, 10am, 11am, 3pm, 12pm, 9am, 1am, 8am, 1pm, 2pm, 2am, 7am, 3am, 6am, 4am, and 5am.\nIn short, I focused on the data sets of traffic incidents in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Chicago. In the first analysis, I explored the relationship between race and the number of stops (categorized as pedestrian and vehicular) in Los Angeles. It was found that Hispanic people have the most stops among all the races, and vehicular stops are more than pedestrian stops. In the second analysis, I scrutinized the number of stops in different days of a week in San Francisco. I found that there are more stops on the weekdays than weekends. In the third analysis, I examined the number of stops in each hour of a day. It was found that most traffic incidents happened between 5pm to 12am."
