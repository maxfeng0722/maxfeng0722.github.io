I'm Junshu Feng, and you can call me Max. I am a junior at Pomona College majoring in mathematics and minoring in data science. I am from Changzhou, China. It's a relatively small city but it's only one hour away from Shanghai by train. I love my neighborhoods because of the amazing restaurants nearby. I love music and sports. I also love to hang out with my friends.
