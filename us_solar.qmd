The original data comes from: <https://emp.lbl.gov/utility-scale-solar>

```{r}
capacity <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2022/2022-05-03/capacity.csv', show_col_types = FALSE)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(capacity, aes(x = year, y = total_gw)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = type)) + 
  labs(
    y = "total gigawatts",
    title = "total capacity of different source types from 2014 to 2020"
  )

```

In this analysis, I made a scatterplot of the total capacity of different source types such as solar and wind from 2014 to 2020. The x-axis is the year ranging from 2014 to 2020, and the y-axis represents the total capacity of the energy sources in gigawatts. Different colors represent different energy types.
