The original data comes from: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results/>

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
olympics <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2024/2024-08-06/olympics.csv', show_col_types = FALSE)
sub_olympics <- olympics |>
dplyr::filter(!is.na(olympics $ height))
ggplot(sub_olympics, aes(x = year, y = height, color = sex)) +
geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
labs(title = "Height of athletes in different years")
```

In this analysis, I made a scatterplot of the height of the athletes from 1896 to 2016. The x-axis is the year ranging from 1896 to 2016, and the y-axis is the height of the athletes in centimeters. The red data points represent female athletes while the green data points represent male athletes.
